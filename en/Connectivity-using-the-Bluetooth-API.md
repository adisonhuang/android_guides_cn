## Overview

The Android platform includes support for the Bluetooth network stack, which allows a device to wirelessly exchange data with other Bluetooth devices. The application framework provides access to the Bluetooth functionality through the Android Bluetooth APIs. These APIs let applications wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices, enabling point-to-point and multipoint wireless features.

Using the Bluetooth APIs, an Android application can perform the following:

 * Scan for other Bluetooth devices
 * Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
 * Connect to other devices through service discovery
 * Transfer data to and from other devices
 * Manage multiple connections
