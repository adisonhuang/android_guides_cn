## Carolyn Dolnick's Plan

Carolyn Dolnick from Lookout embarked on learning Android coming from a data background. The resources she used are listed below:

1. Learn Java Well with [Stanford CS 106A](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/Stanford-CS-106A/wiki/Stanford-Introduction-To-Computer-Science-Programming-Methodology-CS106A-Class-Guide)
2. Learn about Git Version Control via [Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud775)
3. Learn about Data Structures via [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-data-structures-algorithms-in-java/)
4. Start with [this Udacity Course by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) and reference [our getting started resources](https://guides.codepath.com/android#getting-started). 
5. Request [free observer access](mailto:contact@codepath.com) to our CodePath Android Bootcamp by explaining what you've accomplished and supplying your github handle. Build weekly apps assigned in the course.
