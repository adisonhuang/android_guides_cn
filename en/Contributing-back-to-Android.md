## Overview

The source code for Android is available at [[https://android.googlesource.com]].

It's important to note that the open source project for Android consists of [multiple Git repositories](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+/master/default.xml). While each Git repo can be cloned separately, Google provides a special [repo](https://source.android.com/source/developing.html) script to help retrieve all of them. This script also helps automate the process of submitting pull request changes to the [repository](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open), so you
will need to use this tool for any code changes.

While downloading and building the entire tree requires at least 100GB and usually relies on building on
certain machines according to [the official docs](https://source.android.com/source/building.html), you
can also build portions of the repo without needing this much disk space.   One downside however is that
initially downloading the Git data from all the repos still takes at least 1-3 hours.

## Building Android Tools

This walkthrough shows an example of how you can build the [Android Tools](http://tools.android.com/overview) repository. It is intended to show how you can contribute back to any part of the Android open source code, such as the components that work with Android Studio, the native emulator, the 9-patch viewer, etc.  It also will show you how to setup with a Java IDE to be able to set breakpoints and understand the code better.

### Preliminary Setup

See the [instructions] (http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html) to make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries.  You will need at least JDK 7 installed.  There isn't much setup work needed for OS X, but follow the `apt-get` install commands if running Ubuntu-based machines.  If you are using Ubuntu 15.04 machines, you may need to run these commands at the minimum to get the Tools repository to compile:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 lib32z1
sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so
```

Download the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).   You will be able to use this IDE to compile and troubleshoot any of the Java-based tools.

### Install the Repo client

The first step necessary is to download the `repo` client, which helps manage all the various Android repos.

#### Create a `~/bin` directory

You will need to download and store the repo script somewhere.  The [official docs](https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html) recommend storing the program
in a `~/bin` directory accessible through the `PATH` environment variable.

```bash
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```

#### Downloading the repo client

```bash
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

## Downloading the source code

Use the repo client to download the latest branch:

```bash
$ mkdir studio-1.4-dev
$ cd studio-1.4-dev
$ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b studio-1.4-dev
$ repo sync
```

When the `repo init` command is run, it will first download code from its own [repository](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/master).  It uses the [manifest repository](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+/master/default.xml) to determine what Android repositories are available.  You can type `repo help` or check out the [sub commands](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/master/subcmds/) to see what functions are supported.

The [overview page](http://tools.android.com/build) lists all the available branches to use.   Most likely you should pick the current development branch.  Android Studio and Gradle versions are often released at different times, so there are also separate Git tags created.  For instance, if you wish to check out tagged releases for Gradle releases, you can also look through the [list of tagged branches](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+refs) and use repo to switch to this branch by typing:

```bash
repo init -b gradle_1.3.1
repo sync
```

The `repo sync` script will refetch any changes.  If you have made any changes in this repo, you may need to do the equivalent of resetting your changes across all Android repositories before attempting to run the sync command.

```bash
repo forall -vc "git reset --hard"
```

After running `repo`, you should have a `tools/` directory created.  There should be many subdirectories under this directory such as `base`, `emulator`, and `gradle` too.  Many of these directories are also separate Git repositories.

#### Editing the build.gradle

The current tools project requires Java 1.6 and prevents you from building unless Java v1.6 is used.  Assuming you have downloaded the latest branch, you can edit the `tools/build.gradle` in this directory and change the `requiredVersion` check to match the version you are running.  You can obviously set an environment variable to do the same as well.

```gradle
task('checkJavaVersion') << {
    def jvmVersion = System.getProperty('java.version')
    def requiredVersion = System.getenv('JAVA_FOR_TESTS') ?: '1.6'
    if (!jvmVersion.startsWith(requiredVersion)) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Tools need to be compiled with Java $requiredVersion, you are using Java $jvmVersion.")
    }
}
```

This [pull request](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/157841/) is intended to modify the behavior to allow any version of Java v1.6 to run.

#### Updating gradle.properties

You should have a `tools/gradle/wrapper/gradle.properties` already created as well.  Currently [this file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/gradle/+/master/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties) assumes that
you have Gradle stored in a `external/gradle` directory.  You can change the `distributionUrl` reference to point to a remote URL, which will be fetched if it doesn't currently exist:

```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.2.1-all.zip
```

If you forget this step, IntellIJ will likely complain about not having a Gradle Home setup.

#### Changing the output directory

Normally the Tools project will try to store all the intermediate builds inside a common `build/` directory in the main repo. There is a [current issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-122577) with IntelliJ v13.1 and up that prevents you from doing so.

If you see "Can't register given path of type 'SOURCE' because it's out of content root", you will need to change
the `project.buildDir` as shown:

```
subprojects { Project project ->
    // Change buildDir first so that all plugins pick up the new value.
    //  project.buildDir = project.file("$project.parent.buildDir/../$project.name/build")
    project.buildDir = project.file("build")
}
```

#### Opening with a Java IDE

You should now be able to open the `tools/build.gradle` file.  Import the project and make sure that the Gradle wrapper option is selected.  You should be able to build the project successfully.

You can find any of the tests, right click on the file, and click on the `Debug option`..

### Experimenting with changes

Click on the Gradle icon on the right side of the screen and find the `publishLocal` option by going to `tools`->`Tasks`->`other`->`publishLocal`.  Click on it to save it to an `/out/repo` directory that will be used in the next step.

<img src="https://imgur.com/zVY3y3S.png"/>

You can also type the same command at the command-line:

```bash
./gradlew publishLocal
```

If you wish to experiment with the changes made with this new package, you can simply modify your `app/build.gradle`.  You would add an extra `maven` reference to the `out/repo` directory created. Assuming you were experimenting on the `gradle:1.4.0-beta` branch, your configuration would look like the following:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url '/home/johndoe/projects/android/out/repo/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.4.0-beta'
```

### Submitting changes

You must first start a branch using the repo command:

```bash
repo start <branch_name> <project_name>
```

The project name can be determined by looking through the [manifest file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+/master/default.xml).  For instance, the Tools project has multiple project names: `platform/tools/base`, `platform/tools/build`, `platform/tools/emulator`, etc.

The branch name can refer to any name you wish.  It is a name that you will create locally and should refer to the set of changes for a particular improvement or feature change.

Once you've started a branch, you can go into the individual repositories and use Git as you normally would to add, revise, and commit changes.   To create a pull request, you can type `repo upload`.  If you revise any changes, you would use the same command too.

See the [Google guide](https://source.android.com/source/submit-patches.html) for submitting patches.
