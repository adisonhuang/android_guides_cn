## Overview

In certain situations, we need to implement a ListView where there are **different types of rows** in the same list. In other words, different items in the list need to be represented differently. Examples include a Tumblr client where each post might be an image, text or a video. Another example would be Facebook with the many different types of feed items.

To implement a heterogenous list of items, most of the work is done **within the adapter**. In particular, there are special methods to be overridden within an adapter such as `getItemViewType`, `getViewTypeCount` specifically for these situations.

## Implementation

Suppose we wanted to implement a heterogenous list of items in an application. Keep in mind that each item in this list should be implemented with a common base model.  

### Define the Enum Values

The first step therefore is to create a model flexible enough to support all the types (i.e `Post`) and embed a mechanism to determine the type.  Let's pick a simple example such as list of colors in which each color is represented differently:

```java
public class SimpleColor {
	public enum ColorValues {
		RED, BLUE, GREEN
	}

	public SimpleColor(String label, ColorValues color) {
		super();
		this.label = label;
		this.color = color;
	}

	public String label;
	public ColorValues color;

}
```

Here we have an enum and a field that represents the color type. We can also have additional fields and information for each type. 

### Define Adapter Type Methods

Now, we need to create an adapter that supports this heterogenous set of colors each represented differently. The skeleton for this type of heterogenous list is a few key methods such as [getViewTypeCount](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Adapter.html#getViewTypeCount\(\)) and [getItemViewType](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Adapter.html#getItemViewType\(int\)):

```java
public class ColorArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<SimpleColor> {
    public ColorArrayAdapter(Context context, ArrayList<SimpleColor> colors) {
        super(context, 0, colors);
    }
    
    // Returns the number of types of Views that will be created by getView(int, View, ViewGroup)
    @Override
    public int getViewTypeCount() {
       // Returns the number of types of Views that will be created by this adapter
       // Each type represents a set of views that can be converted
    }
    
    // Get the type of View that will be created by getView(int, View, ViewGroup) 
    // for the specified item.
    @Override
    public int getItemViewType(int position) {
       // Return an integer here representing the type of View.
       // Note: Integers must be in the range 0 to getViewTypeCount() - 1
    }
     
    // Get a View that displays the data at the specified position in the data set. 
    @Override
    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
       // View should be created based on the type returned from `getItemViewType(int position)`
       // convertView is guaranteed to be the "correct" recycled type
    }
}
```

For example, here's how the adapter might look for an adapter responsible for creating a list of items that are represented differently based on their color:

```java
public class ColorArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<SimpleColor> {
	public ColorArrayAdapter(Context context, ArrayList<SimpleColor> colors) {
		super(context, 0, colors);
	}
         
        // Return an integer representing the type by fetching the enum type ordinal
	@Override
	public int getItemViewType(int position) {
		return getItem(position).color.ordinal();
	}
        
        // Total number of types is the number of enum values
	@Override
	public int getViewTypeCount() {
		return SimpleColor.ColorValues.values().length;
	}

	@Override
	public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
		// Get the data item for this position
		SimpleColor color = getItem(position);
		// Check if an existing view is being reused, otherwise inflate the view
		if (convertView == null) {
			// Get the data item type for this position
			int type = getItemViewType(position);
			// Inflate XML layout based on the type     
			convertView = getInflatedLayoutForType(type);
		}
		// Lookup view for data population
		TextView tvLabel = (TextView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.tvLabel);
		if (tvLabel != null) {
			// Populate the data into the template view using the data object
			tvLabel.setText(color.label);
		}
		// Return the completed view to render on screen
		return convertView;
	}
        
        // Given the item type, responsible for returning the correct inflated XML layout file
	private View getInflatedLayoutForType(int type) {
		if (type == ColorValues.BLUE.ordinal()) {
			return LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_blue_color, null);
		} else if (type == ColorValues.RED.ordinal()) {
			return LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_red_color, null);
		} else if (type == ColorValues.GREEN.ordinal()) {
			return LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_green_color, null);
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}
}
```

Note that **once `getItemViewType` is defined**, the `convertView` object is guaranteed to be the "correct" type to ensure that recycling views is relatively straightforward. 

### Populating the Adapter

Now we can attach this together within an activity and populate a ListView with:

```java
public class HeterogenousListActivity extends Activity {
	private ListView lvColors;

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
		lvColors = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.lvColors);
		ArrayList<SimpleColor> aColors = new ArrayList<SimpleColor>();
		// Populate colors into the array
		aColors.add(new SimpleColor("Blue", ColorValues.BLUE)); 
		aColors.add(new SimpleColor("Green", ColorValues.GREEN));
		// Attach the adapter
		ColorArrayAdapter adapterColors = new ColorArrayAdapter(this, aColors);
		lvColors.setAdapter(adapterColors);
	}
}
```

Here we've attached the array into an adapter and then populated the ListView as always. The result might look like this:

This is a simple example for demonstration purposes. See [this article](https://edisonthk.wordpress.com/2014/06/12/constraints-of-multiple-layouts-listview-for-android/) for a more detailed overview.

### ViewHolder for Performance

As with any list within a production application, we will want to apply the [[ViewHolder Pattern|Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView#improving-performance-with-the-viewholder-pattern]] for smooth scrolling by caching the subview lookups. In this case, you'll need multiple ViewHolder classes (one per type) as [outlined in this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3515221/313399).

### RecyclerView and Multiple Types

`RecyclerView` is a [[newer alternative|Using-the-RecyclerView]] to the `ListView` and has a separate adapter system that works differently then the content described above. Refer to the [[Heterogenous Layouts Inside RecyclerView]] to learn more about how to render multiple item types within the `RecyclerView`
