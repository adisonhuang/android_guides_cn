## Overview

A Notification Service is a process that once registered in the manifest can listen for predefined events and respond by notifying the user via an Android Notification. 

Using this method we can serve content directly to our users in a highly visible manner. Combining the a Notification with a background Service; we can begin to dynamically inform the user about any events we care to write.

In this example we will cover Notification Services of the following types:
